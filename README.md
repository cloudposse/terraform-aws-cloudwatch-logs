[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-logs/releases).


```terraform
module "cloudwatch_log" {
  namespace    = "${var.namespace}"
  stage        = "${var.stage}"
  stream_names = ["kafka-instance-1", "kafka-instance-2"]
}
```






## Makefile Targets
```
Available targets:

  help                                Help screen
  help/all                            Display help for all targets
  help/short                          This help short screen
  lint                                Lint terraform code

```
## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| additional_permissions | Additional permissions granted to assumed role | list | `<list>` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `policy` or `role`) | list | `<list>` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `name`, `namespace`, `stage`, etc. | string | `-` | no |
| enabled | If true, deploy the resources for the module | string | `true` | no |
| kms_key_arn | The ARN of the KMS Key to use when encrypting log data. Please note, after the AWS KMS CMK is disassociated from the log group, AWS CloudWatch Logs stops encrypting newly ingested data for the log group. All previously ingested data remains encrypted, and AWS CloudWatch Logs requires permissions for the CMK whenever the encrypted data is requested. | string | `` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `bastion` or `db`) | string | `` | no |
| namespace | Namespace (e.g. `cp` or `cloudposse`) | string | - | yes |
| principals | Map of service name as key and a list of ARNs to allow assuming the role as value. (e.g. map(`AWS`, list(`arn:aws:iam:::role/admin`))) | map | `<map>` | no |
| retention_in_days | Number of days you want to retain log events in the log group | string | `30` | no |
| stage | Stage (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`) | string | - | yes |
| stream_names | Names of streams | list | `<list>` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`) | map | `<map>` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| log_group_arn | ARN of the log group |
| log_group_name | Name of log group |
| role_arn | ARN of role to assume |
| role_name | Name of role to assume |
| stream_arns | ARN of the log stream |
